    <h2>The Man and The Serpent </h2>
<div class="text-content">

<p>A Countryman's son by accident trod upon a Serpent's tail,
which turned and bit him so that he died.  The father in a rage
got his axe, and pursuing the Serpent, cut off part of its tail.
So the Serpent in revenge began stinging several of the Farmer's
cattle and caused him severe loss. Well, the Farmer thought it
best to make it up with the Serpent, and brought food and honey to
the mouth of its lair, and said to it: "Let's forget and forgive;
perhaps you were right to punish my son, and take vengeance on my
cattle, but surely I was right in trying to revenge him; now that
we are both satisfied why should not we be friends again?"</p>

<P class="fable-moral"> No, no," said the Serpent; "take away your gifts; you can
never forget the death of your son, nor I the loss of my tail."
Injuries may be forgiven, but not forgotten.</p>

  <h2>The Man and the Lion </h2>

  <div class="text-content">
<p> A Man and a Lion traveled together through the forest. They soon began
to boast of their respective superiority to each other in strength and
prowess. As they were disputing, they passed a statue carved in stone,
which represented “a Lion strangled by a Man.” The traveler pointed to
it and said: “See there! How strong we are, and how we prevail over even
the king of beasts.” The Lion replied: “This statue was made by one of
you men. If we Lions knew how to erect statues, you would see the Man
placed under the paw of the Lion.”</p>

  <h2>The Farmer and the Cranes</h2>

<div class="text-content">
<p> Some cranes made their feeding grounds on some plowlands newly sown with
wheat. For a long time the Farmer, brandishing an empty sling, chased
them away by the terror he inspired; but when the birds found that the
sling was only swung in the air, they ceased to take any notice of it
and would not move. The Farmer, on seeing this, charged his sling with
stones, and killed a great number. The remaining birds at once forsook
his fields, crying to each other, “It is time for us to be off to
Liliput: for this man is no longer content to scare us, but begins to
show us in earnest what he can do.”</p>
<P class="fable-moral"> If words suffice not, blows must follow.</p>
